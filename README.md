In this group project, with the combine use of HTML, CSS, Tailwind and JavaScript, we created a web page that allows users to view live and upcoming premier league football scores as well as betting odds. We used two third party APIs to get all the information needed to complete the project. 

When the user opens the web page, they are presented with the main page that contains the week's football fixtures. In the navigation bar, there's an "About" link that takes the user to separate page that tells a little bit more about the project and its contributors. The user can navigate back to the main page by clicking the "matches" button in the navigation bar. When on the main page, by the click of a button in each fixture's card, the user has the ability to view each fixture's betting odds. 

Here is the link to the web page
